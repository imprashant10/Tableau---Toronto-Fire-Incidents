This repository contains a Tableau dashboard for Toronto Fire Incidents. The dataset includes information about the origin of fire, area of origin, fire system operation, person displaced by the extent of fire, fire alarm system operation, and estimated loss. The data was processed and cleaned using Python and its libraries such as Pandas and NumPy. The cleaned data was then analyzed using Tableau to create insightful visualizations on Toronto Fire Incidents.

Process:

Data Processing and Cleaning: The dataset was initially in a raw and unstructured format consisting of various types of data fields. We used Python and its libraries to clean and preprocess the data. The following steps were involved in the data cleaning process:
Removal of duplicates and missing values.
Handling of outliers and anomalies.
Data normalization and transformation.
Feature engineering and selection.
Data formatting and exporting to a CSV file.
Creating Visualizations using Tableau: The processed data was imported into Tableau to create visualizations that can easily be interpreted and understood. We used various types of charts and plots to present different aspects of the data, including bar charts, line charts, and heat maps. The following are the main visualizations created:
Area of Origin vs. Dollar Loss
Fire Alarm System Operation and Estimated Loss
Fire System Operation and Person Displaced
Fire Incidents by Area of Origin
Insights and Suggestions:
The Area of Origin vs. Dollar Loss visualization reveals that the most significant dollar losses occur in the living area, followed by the exterior, wall, and garage. This finding suggests that there is a need to focus on fire safety measures in these specific areas.
The Fire Alarm System Operation and Estimated Loss visualization indicates that the estimated loss is significantly lower when the fire alarm system operates compared to when it does not operate or when the operation is undetermined. This finding highlights the importance of having a functioning fire alarm system.
The Fire System Operation and Person Displaced visualization suggests that the majority of fire incidents occur in the engine area or cooking area, resulting in a higher number of persons displaced.
The Fire Incidents by Area of Origin visualization indicates that the majority of fire incidents occur in the exterior, wall, and garage areas.
Suggestions for Lowering Toronto Fire Incidents:
Implementing fire safety measures in the living area, such as fire-resistant materials and smoke detectors.
Ensuring that fire alarm systems are functioning correctly and regularly inspected.
Providing education and awareness programs on fire safety measures and the importance of having a functioning fire alarm system.
Implementing regular fire safety inspections and maintenance in buildings, particularly in areas with a higher incidence of fire incidents.
